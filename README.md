# Sustaining Women and Education

Some of the files for the women and data hackathon (complete project overview will be on [my personal website](https://jaimeeyeung.com/)), 
comprised of files using time-series + ARIMA models to predict future values in rates of women's education and unemployment.

This project's main focus is on the "Quality Education" sustainable devlopment goal amongst 173 countries, with a sole focus on women, education, and employability.
